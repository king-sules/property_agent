# AI Email Agent

This project is an AI-powered email agent that reads emails from your Gmail inbox, generates responses using Google's Gemini (Vertex AI), and sends/drafts replies automatically. More specifically, this is a property agent, who is answering emails from potential tenents. Although there are plenty of AI automation platforms out there, this project showcases how it can be done all by scratch. 

## Features
- Reads unread emails from Gmail
- Uses Gemini to generate context-aware replies
- Sends responses via Gmail API
- Slightly challenging setup, since this is all from scratch

## Architecture and Tech Stack
- Firebase, for conversational storage, and property context (high level RAG)
- API and OAuth networks
- Gemini LLM (Vertex AI)
- Gmail
- JSON
- Langchain
